# Teacher-Student Management System (Flask Web Application)

## Project Overview

This Flask web application implements a multi-role user management system with distinct logins for **Teachers**, **Students**, and an **Admin**. It supports:

- Registration and login for Teachers and Students.
- Admin approval of newly registered users.
- Viewing of approved Teachers by Students and vice versa.
- Role-based access control ensuring users access appropriate views.

This project demonstrates fundamental Flask concepts such as routing, template rendering, user roles, and approval workflows.
